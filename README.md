# Analysis-of-Amazon-Delivery-Operations
This repository presents a detailed academic analysis of Amazon's delivery operations, enhanced with Python scripting and machine learning concepts to support data-driven insights. The project explores Amazon’s complex logistics ecosystem, including fulfillment centers, sortation hubs, and last-mile delivery systems, with a focus on efficiency, scalability, and innovation.

Python was used to script data processing workflows, generate visualizations, and simulate aspects of delivery performance. Machine learning techniques were applied for predictive modeling, such as estimating delivery delays and analyzing route optimization. These models helped assess Amazon’s ability to maintain fast, cost-effective, and customer-centric delivery services.

By combining business analysis with technical tools, this project delivers actionable insights and strategic recommendations. It addresses challenges such as operational costs, delivery delays, and sustainability concerns. Visualizations generated using Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) accompany the written analysis to illustrate trends and performance metrics.

Developed as part of an academic group project, this work reflects interdisciplinary skills in data analysis, machine learning, and operations research. It showcases the practical application of Python and ML in studying real-world logistics systems and supports a deeper understanding of supply chain optimization through technology.

Included in the repository are the full research report, Python scripts, data files (or simulated data), and presentation materials. Together, these components provide a comprehensive view of Amazon’s delivery infrastructure, with technical and strategic perspectives.

This project serves as a valuable reference for students, researchers, and professionals interested in e-commerce logistics, supply chain analytics, and the intersection of machine learning and operational strategy.

### Dataset Description – Amazon Delivery Operations:
This dataset contains information related to Amazon delivery operations, focusing on various factors that may influence delivery time efficiency. It includes both numerical and categorical features covering delivery logistics, environmental conditions, agent profiles, and delivery specifics. The primary aim is to analyze and predict delivery times based on these features.
