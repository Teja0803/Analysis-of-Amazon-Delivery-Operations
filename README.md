# Analysis-of-Amazon-Delivery-Operations
This repository presents an academic analysis of Amazon's delivery operations, integrating Python scripting and machine learning to derive data-driven insights. The project examines Amazon’s logistics network, including fulfillment centers, sortation hubs, and last-mile delivery systems, emphasizing efficiency, scalability, and innovation. Python was used to preprocess data, generate visualizations, and simulate delivery performance. Machine learning models were applied to predict delivery delays and optimize routing, offering insights into Amazon’s ability to deliver fast and cost-effectively. The analysis combines business strategy with technical tools to address challenges like operational costs and sustainability. Visualizations created using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn enhance understanding of performance metrics. Developed as part of an academic group project, this work demonstrates interdisciplinary skills in data analysis, ML, and operations research. The repository includes the full report, Python scripts, data (or simulated data), and presentation slides—serving as a resource for those interested in e-commerce logistics and technology-driven supply chains.
